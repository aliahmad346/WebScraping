#### Detailed Project Description: 

We scrape data for individual players from the website understat which can be utilized for further data analysis and model building. Data can be found for a player with multiple features (goals, assists, appearances, etc.) pertaining to their performance for each season. The algorithm requires input from the user, where a unique player code found on the website is entered and all related statistics are imported in the python notebook.
